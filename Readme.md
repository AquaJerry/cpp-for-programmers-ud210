## What is C++

> C++ is a programming language. It's quite mainly for applications that are
> very demanding on performance, energy consumtion and speed. If you don't have
> serious constraints on your problem, then you can probably do with other some
> language. But if you're really concerned about the reliability, performance
> and response time, C++ becomes a good choice.

Bjarne Stroustrup, designer, original implementor of C++
