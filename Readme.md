## Bjarne Stroustrup Interview

Bjarne Stroustrup, designer, original implementor of C++

### What Is C++

> C++ is a programming language. It's quite mainly for applications that are
> very demanding on performance, energy consumtion and speed. If you don't have
> serious constraints on your problem, then you can probably do with other some
> language. But if you're really concerned about the reliability, performance
> and response time, C++ becomes a good choice.

### Why Learn C++

> The first is, it's really useful. That is, so many things are programs in
> C++. Your camera is probably programmed in C++. Your cellphones have C++ on
> it. Data science has C++, self-driving cars, Mars rovers... It's all over the
> place. So it doesn't really matter much what you're interested in, there
> would be a job for writing C++ in that field.

> Secondly, it's a language with lots of features. So you can use it to learn
> the fundamentals of quite a few variations of programming. And so you can
> learn how to work with data structures, wirte down patterns or high-level
> generic code in it and you can fiddle with bits of hardware in it.

> A lot of languages are built to one thing: all they protect you against some
> of the unpleasantness of the real world to the point where you can actually
> learn how to deal with it. And So C++ can be very useful as a learning tool
> to learn how to program.

### Where Is C++ Used

> As a person I like to see C++ being used in interesting places like your
> camera there, the Mars rovers and telescopes. I work in the finance industry
> now. A lot of networking is done in C++. The games industry, most of the
> graphics and animation, kind of stuff is in C++. So is most of the animation
> in Hollywood. (Hollywood, by the way, I've forgotten about that.) The
> mentioned cars, there's a lot of C++ in cars. BMW uses C++ to control their
> cars. And in these days, the self-driving cars, a lot of that work is in C++
> too. We're talking about the energy industry using it. The wind turbines are
> using it a lot. I was aware of them many years ago, teaching C++ to some of
> the people to build the biggest wind turbines in the world. So one of the
> things I've found really cool about C++ is whatever you're interested in,
> it's very a good way of getting hundreds of people doing these interesting
> things in interesting places. But the interesting things and unusual things
> is what you control about, the smart watches, the smart phones, things like
> that.

### What Makes C++ Different

> C++ differs from most more modern programming languages by working directly
> on the hardware and working very efficiently with the hardware. And then, it
> provides really strong attraction mechanisms that are very powerful, very
> modern so that you don't have to deal with the low-level stuff all the time.
> And you can still be efficient.

### Use Comments Judiciously

> Comments should be used to say things that you can't do what in code.
> Obviously the code tells you how something's done. It doesn't tell you what
> at a high-level is being done or why is being done. Without that comment you
> don't really know what the code is supposed to do.

### How to Learn C++

> The way I describe this, it's like when you come to a new city. You want to
> have an overview of the city and you can take a city tour. And then, most big
> cities have a city tour, right? You go on a bus and somebody would tell you,
> look, there's a big church, there's a museum and there's a good restaurant.
> And, after a while you'll get some kind of idea. And if you have more time,
> you'll go and begin to see if the food really was good and see if the church
> was worth visiting for art or whatever. And I think that's the model for
> learning programming: get an overview and then take into the details. Teach
> the concepts in the context of concrete examples. People don't get abstract
> ideas without examples. They just don't get it.

### C++ Guidelines

> You can do many things in C++ and yet some of them are quite stupid. And you
> know you can write bad code in any programming language so C++ is not unique
> in that. Sometimes the education is weak, so they lead people into writing
> some of those stupid things and it pains me! And I think we just have to do
> better and not send students into making mistakes. The guidelines project
> that mentioned earlier is an effort to focus people's attentions on the good
> bits, the things that we know it works. And get them out of the dark corners
> of the obvious mistakes.
