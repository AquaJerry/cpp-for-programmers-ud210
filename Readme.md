## Bjarne Stroustrup Interview

Bjarne Stroustrup, designer, original implementor of C++

### What Is C++

> C++ is a programming language. It's quite mainly for applications that are
> very demanding on performance, energy consumtion and speed. If you don't have
> serious constraints on your problem, then you can probably do with other some
> language. But if you're really concerned about the reliability, performance
> and response time, C++ becomes a good choice.

### Why Learn C++

> The first is, it's really useful. That is, so many things are programs in
> C++. Your camera is probably programmed in C++. Your cellphones have C++ on
> it. Data science has C++, self-driving cars, Mars rovers... It's all over the
> place. So it doesn't really matter much what you're interested in, there
> would be a job for writing C++ in that field.

> Secondly, it's a language with lots of features. So you can use it to learn
> the fundamentals of quite a few variations of programming. And so you can
> learn how to work with data structures, wirte down patterns or high-level
> generic code in it and you can fiddle with bits of hardware in it.

> A lot of languages are built to one thing: all they protect you against some
> of the unpleasantness of the real world to the point where you can actually
> learn how to deal with it. And So C++ can be very useful as a learning tool
> to learn how to program.

### Where Is C++ Used

> As a person I like to see C++ being used in interesting places like your
> camera there, the Mars rovers and telescopes. I work in the finance industry
> now. A lot of networking is done in C++. The games industry, most of the
> graphics and animation, kind of stuff is in C++. So is most of the animation
> in Hollywood. (Hollywood, by the way, I've forgotten about that.) The
> mentioned cars, there's a lot of C++ in cars. BMW uses C++ to control their
> cars. And in these days, the self-driving cars, a lot of that work is in C++
> too. We're talking about the energy industry using it. The wind turbines are
> using it a lot. I was aware of them many years ago, teaching C++ to some of
> the people to build the biggest wind turbines in the world. So one of the
> things I've found really cool about C++ is whatever you're interested in,
> it's very a good way of getting hundreds of people doing these interesting
> things in interesting places. But the interesting things and unusual things
> is what you control about, the smart watches, the smart phones, things like
> that.

### What Makes C++ Different

> C++ differs from most more modern programming languages by working directly
> on the hardware and working very efficiently with the hardware. And then, it
> provides really strong attraction mechanisms that are very powerful, very
> modern so that you don't have to deal with the low-level stuff all the time.
> And you can still be efficient.

### Use Comments Judiciously

> Comments should be used to say things that you can't do what in code.
> Obviously the code tells you how something's done. It doesn't tell you what
> at a high-level is being done or why is being done. Without that comment you
> don't really know what the code is supposed to do.
