## Interview with Bjarne Stroustrup

Bjarne Stroustrup, designer, original implementor of C++

### What Is C++

> C++ is a programming language. It's quite mainly for applications that are
> very demanding on performance, energy consumtion and speed. If you don't have
> serious constraints on your problem, then you can probably do with other some
> language. But if you're really concerned about the reliability, performance
> and response time, C++ becomes a good choice.

### Why Learn C++

> The first is, it's really useful. That is, so many things are programs in
> C++. Your camera is probably programmed in C++. Your cellphones have C++ on
> it. Data science has C++, self-driving cars, mars rovers... It's all over the
> place. So it doesn't really matter much what you're interested in, there
> would be a job for writing C++ in that field.
