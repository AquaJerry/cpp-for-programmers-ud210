# Pointers

## Why Learn Pointers

> A language like Java also has pointers. They just call them references. And
> in C++ when you deal with the low-level pointers, basically, machine
> addresses and word widths. But then you hide them. We use a vector. You don't
> need a pointer for that. You just have a local variable that's a vector. And
> in that variable the vector handles the memory's changing size and such
> similar changes. It uses pointers for those. But you don't have to use it. So
> vectors, strings and such eliminates pointer use. And actually C++ uses a lot
> of local variables, general local variables. So if you go into generated
> code, there's actually few of pointers. Then you'll find in most languages
> it's one of the reasons it run fast because you don't have to dereference all
> these pointers, chase pointers around. You'll just find data right there in
> stack. Pointers are fundamental to deal with hardware. Then you use that to
> implement higher-level abstractions.
